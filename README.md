# WRWC Predictive Streamflow Model
Welcome to the Wood River Water Collaborative code base for predicting annual streamflow and water rights curtailment dates!
This modeling tool automatically downloads input data and predicts total irrigation season (April- Sept) flow, and curtailment dates for the Big Wood River at Hailey and at Stanton Crossing, Camas Creek, and Silver Creek at Sportsman's Access

# Getting Started
Download code zip file, or clone the git repository using the terminal (git clone <URL> ).

Run <> to install all packages required by the model. 

Add date <here in the code>
  
Run <> to download data and run model.


# Model Details

The suite of predictive models are mltivariate regression models, meaning they are all statistically based rather than processed based. This means that the model predictions are soley based on historical relationships, while this makes for efficient model runs, if something changes significantly in a given watershed (e.g. fire in the headwaters), the model will not be able to predict streamflow conditions as well.

# Model Support
If you run the model and an error occurs, the process for getting help is to raise an 'issue', you can do this by ..., this will automatically send me an email so that I can help resolve the issue.
